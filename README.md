Empirical-UserMigration
=======================

Thank you for your proposal.  Although the proposal gives an interesting topic,  I am concerned that the proposed project does not go into enough depth for a strong project. Questions over time for a topic is a simple analysis and has been done countless times before.

However, you have the opportunity to do a really interesting project by shifting the focus slightly.  I want you to study user migration between communities.  

What I mean is being able to first categorize a particular developer as belonging more either the iOS or Android community.  Then be able to observe any changes over time to detect if or when an user transitions to becoming more active in another community and less activity in the other.  Third, aggregating these types of events into a sensible visualization or report.  Finally, as a stretch goal -- identify if there are any large events or potential causes related to the migration.
